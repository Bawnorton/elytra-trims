1.20 introduces armor trims to the game, which give players great tools for customising their look. However, elytras were left out. This mod provides elytra trims support, customisable with resourcepacks!

## Setup
### Client
- Install the mod and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
- Launch the game.
- Enable default resourcepack.
In singleplayer enables datapack by default. On 1.19.4 requires 1.20 update datapack enabled.

### Server
- Enable 1.20 update on the server if you're on 1.19.4.
- Install datapack on the server.

## Custom trims
If you want to include elytra trims in your resourcepack read the [Guide](https://github.com/Kikugie/elytra-trims/tree/1.19/resourcepacks)
