### For more trims check out [Elytra Trims Extensions](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-trims-extensions)

## Trims

Put any trim on your elytra just like any other armor. Mod provides a default resourcepack with all vanilla trims, but
it can be expanded further.

## Banner patterns

Combine your elytra with a banner to add intricate patterns and designs to your elytra.

## Dyeing

If you fancy something simplistic, dye your elytra however you want in a crafting table.

## Glowing

Craft your elytra with a glow ink sac to make it glow in the dark.

## Customization

With resourcepack support, you can customize all the mod's features to your liking. Change the texture of your armor
trims or add a unique design to your elytra pattern with ease.

## FAQ
(Elytra Trims will be referred as ET)
> I can't put trims/banner/dyes n the elytra!
- If you're playing on a server, ET has to be installed there. On a paper/purpur/spigot or vanilla server you can use the datapack, but it will only work for trims.
  If you're playing in singleplayer, it means ET is not loaded. Look up on YouTube how to install mods.

> Are there conflicts with other mods?
- [OptiFabric](<https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric>) causes a crash and won't be supported.
- [Customizable Elytra](<https://modrinth.com/mod/customizable-elytra>) overrides elytra renderer entirely (and provides less functionality).
- [DashLoader](<https://modrinth.com/mod/dashloader>) causes trims to not display. The development has been cancelled, no support will be provided.

> How do I use this mod on a server without it?
- Client-side commands are planned, however for now the easiest way is to save trimmed elytra in a creative hotbar and load it on a server.  
  Survival recipes are not possible without the mod installed on the server.

> How can I remove trims/patterns/dye/glow from my elytra?
- To remove patterns, dye and glow (all together), click with elytra on a cauldrow with water.  
Trims can't be removed without other mods due to vanilla parity.

> Trims look bad with capes!
- Install [Mod Menu](<https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu>) and [YACL](<https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl>). In the mods tab find ET and open it's settings. There you can disable rendering elytra capes. This is preferable to the vanilla cape setting because it will keep the cape while not wearing an elytra.
