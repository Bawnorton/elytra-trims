This update reworks how mod compatibility is handled. Notably:
- Elytra Trims renderer now accepts custom models.
- Checks for an item being elytra have been loosened (because some mods don't know how to be normal).
- Trimmable tags are no longer applied dynamically, replaced with optional datapack entries.

## New features
- Spanish translation (muriplz)

## Fixes
- Features not displayed on BetterEnd elytras.
- Banners, dyes and glow not being available for BetterEnd elytras.
- Mekanism elytra not being trimmable
