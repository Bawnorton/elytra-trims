## Changes
- Updated to 1.21. *This (again) required big code changes, so if anything breaks, open an issue report.*
- Several trim textures have been reworked - Vex, Wild, Wayfinder, Raiser, Shaper, Spire and some minor tweaks to other textures. (@masik16u)

If you don't like these designs, the old textures are available as a built-in resourcepack.
