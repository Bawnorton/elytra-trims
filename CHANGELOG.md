## Changes
This update reworks how server-side recipes are handled, resulting in better compatibility.  
1.20.4 and 1.20.6 releases have been discontinued to ease testing. If you're playing on those versions,
consider updating to 1.21 and using ViaFabricPlus/ViaForge to join your server.

## Fixes
- #67 - Client crashing after leaving modded servers
- #77 - Head texture being shown when playing with 3D Skin Layers and First Person Model
- #80 - Crash with Elytra Slot on Neoforge
