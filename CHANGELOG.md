![Banner](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/756612448311705761/1137706298587238400/image.png)
- Support for modded banners (such as [AdditionalBanners](https://modrinth.com/mod/additional-banners) and [Archeology Banners](https://modrinth.com/mod/archaeology-banners))

## Changed
- Elytra textures are now written in their own atlas texture (mostly). This *will* break any addons (including ET extensions 1.1.x)

## Fixed
- Log spam for leggings textures in the runtime trim generation

## Removed
- Lock resourcepack config - it's now built-in
- Runtime trim generation - now always enabled

## Known issues
*I can't believe this shit*
- Color/pattern preview may be rendered too high on the first creation. Restart MC to fix it.
