## Easter eggs!
A "bit" past the Easter, but did you know this mod has easter eggs? Now even more than one!  
This update adds the second ever easter egg for you to find out. If you need a hint, check out my [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/kikugie) posts.  
If you're playing on a server, it will need to update Elytra Trims as well to make this easter egg available.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed texture masking for cases where elytra texture has higher resolution than the overlays.
