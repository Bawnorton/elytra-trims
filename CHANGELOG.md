## Changed
- The banner pattern preview icon is now disabled by default. (bugs out too often and I still don't know why)

## Fixed
- Resource reload crash with [Combatify](https://modrinth.com/mod/combatify)
- (And a nasty atlas texture recreation which could possibly cause a memory leak if you reload resources a thousand times or something)
