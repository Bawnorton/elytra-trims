# Elytra Trims 2.0 - The Broken Promises update
**This update comes with big changes in the code. Let me know on Github or Discord if you have any issues**

## Features
- Forge support  
  *Wait, how did this happen?!*
- Server-side config  
  *Don't like banners? Just disable them!*
  Dedicated servers now generate `elytra-trims-server.json` file in the configs folder, where you can disable recipes.
- Better multiversion support  
  *You probably don't care, but updating is now easier, so good.*

## Changes
- All elytras are now trimmable, including modded ones
- Banner icon temporarily gone, until replaced by a less buggy alternative
